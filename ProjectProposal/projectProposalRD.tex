This app will allow you to play multiple standard games: 3 card, Roulette, and blackjack against a simple AI dealer. The rules for our blackjack game are as follows: the dealer must stand on 17 and blackjack pays 3:2. No actual money will be required to play this game; the money/chips will be completely virtual. However, since this game is mostly played in casinos, our target audience will be adults 18 years old and older.

\section{Introduction}


For now, our project is simply called GambleMania App. It will allow you to play a typical game of blackjack against an AI dealer. The rules for our blackjack game are as follows: the dealer must stand on 17 and blackjack pays 3:2. No actual money will be required to play this game; the money/chips will be completely virtual. However, since this game is mostly played in casinos, our target audience will be adults 18 years old and older. We are making this app for a few reasons. First, we think it will be a fun project to work on. Second, this app will give people the option to play blackjack without actually gambling any real money, which is great for people who either enjoy the game or want to practice. Finally, this project is flexible in that we can add on to the project should we feel that we will finish too soon, and we could possibly even shift to a more complex game such as three-card poker and reuse a lot of code from the GambleMania app.





\subsection{Background}
Minimally, we expect the user to know how to play blackjack. However, we could implement a tutorial as a stretch goal to remove this requirement.

\subsection{Impacts}
Although our project is very small and limited, if distributed the project could possibly have a cultural impact by getting more people into the game of blackjack. It could also potentially be used for data research by simulating thousands or millions of blackjack hands.
\subsection{Challenges}
We forsee the most challenging part of this project as how the dealer AI is going to work. will be having a deck object with an array of 56 cards. 
\\
Another challenging part of this project would be creating the graphical user interface for the app should we decide to do so.



\section{Scope}
with a implemented a main menu that can let you choose between 3 games and lets you exit the program. and have implemented the 3 games, 3 card, rouillete and blackjack.\\
will have multiple designs for each card in the deck. 

In the best case (user interface), we will be done when with this project when the user can accurately play as many blackjack hands as they want through a functional and stylish user interface.\\
As mentioned earlier in this paper, there are a few stretch goals we can potentially meet should we be able to do so:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a tutorial for users who do not know how to play blackjack.
\item Create a graphical user interface.
\item Only if needed: switch to three-card poker.
\end{enumerate}


% that's all folks
