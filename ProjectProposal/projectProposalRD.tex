\begin{abstract}
This app allows the user to play three standard casino games: blackjack, three-card poker, and roulette. The player will play against an AI dealer in the blackjack and three-card poker games. In roulette, the program will randomly generate values from the roulette wheel. None of the games in our app will not require any real money to play; all money is virtual and has no monetary value. Users will have their own accounts which will contain login information and the account's balance. This information will be managed with a database.

\section{Introduction}


Our project is called GambleMania. It will allow you to play the typical casino games of blackjack, three-card poker, and roulette. The player's balance will be saved in a database along with their login information. We decided to do this project because we thought it would be fun and require a good bit of research and work to finish. As for why we chose the games previously mentioned, it's because they are all fairly simple games to learn and play (probably by design). Because they are fairly simple, they should be relatively easy to program. Our target audience is adults 18 years old and older because the games featured in out app are all typically played in casinos. We expect our audience to use our app simply for fun or to practice blackjack or three-card poker. We did not include roulette in this list because roulette is based solely on randomness, so you can't really practice it.



\subsection{Background}
Minimally, we expect the user to know how to play blackjack, three-card poker, and roulette. However, we could implement a tutorial as a stretch goal to remove this requirement.

\subsection{Impacts}
Although our project is very small and limited, if distributed the project could possibly have a cultural impact by getting more people into the games of blackjack, three-card poker, and roulette. It could also potentially be used for data research and game theory by simulating thousands or millions of blackjack, three-card poker, and roulette games.

\subsection{Challenges}
We foresee the most challenging part of this project as the way the AI dealer will work in the blackjack and three-card poker games. These games have certain rules that need to be checked. For example, in the blackjack game, the dealer must stand on 17. In three-card poker, the player's hand must be checked against the dealer's hand. We think these kinds of obstacles will be our biggest hurdles.


\section{Scope}
This project will be completed when we have implemented a navigable main menu and the games of blackjack, three-card poker, and roulette. The main menu should minimally allow the user to navigate between games by clicking a button (one for each game) and return to desktop by clicking an exit button. The user must be able to play an accurate game of blackjack with the rules of dealer stands on 17 and blackjack pays 3:2. The user must be able to play an accurate game of three-card poker. A fully functioning roulette table must be implemented. Finally, each of the 56 individual cards in a standard deck of playing cards must be designed.


As mentioned earlier in this paper, there are a few stretch goals we can potentially meet should we be able to do so:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a tutorial for each game for users who do not know how to play.
\item Add more games to the app.
\item Make the main menu and game environments look better.
\item Create a Texas Hold'em style poker game that can be played over a network connection.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirements}
As mentioned in the Scope section, there are many basic requirements that need to be completed in order for this project to be done. There are also a few stretch goals that we could implement should we get done early. The basis of the basic requirements stems from the rules of play for each of the three basic games we will be implementing. There are also requirements that involve the UI design, some of which are simply required for a functional app and others are for a good-looking app. The non-functional requirements are based on how the user will interact with our app. These requirements are not necessarily required for the app to function, but are important for the users of our app.

\subsubsection{Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item A button that exits the program in the main menu and in each of the games.
\item Buttons to navigate from the main menu to each of the games.
\item A back button in each game that navigates the user back to the main menu.
\item Game logic for each game.
\item A Microsoft Access database that stores user login information and user balances.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item User login data is hashed.
\item The app should be responsive and perform well without any major dips in framerate.
\item When the user's balance is modified, it should be updated in the database as soon as possible.
\item The app should be flexible enough so that it is possible to scale it up in the future.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use Cases}
This section defines and ranks the use cases for our project. A table of use cases is shown in Table \ref{tab:useCaseIndex}.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Use Cases}
\label{tab:useCaseIndex}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Use Case 1: Log In}
See Figure \ref{fig:login}
\begin{enumerate}
\item User enters their username and password into the provided text fields.
\item User clicks submit.
\item If the username and password are found in the database, the user proceeds to the main menu. Otherwise, the user must keep entering the username and password until the username and password matches.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Use Case 2: Sign Up}
See Figure \ref{fig:login}
\begin{enumerate}
\item User enters the username and password for their new account.
\item User clicks submit.
\item Account is registered to the database and the user proceeds to the main menu with the new account. The new account will have a starting balance of \$1000.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Use Case 3: Play Blackjack}
See Figure \ref{fig:blackjack}
\begin{enumerate}
\item User places an ante bet.
\item User and dealer are dealt two randomly chosen cards. 
\item User is shown a maximum of four options: Hit, Stand, Double Down, and Split. Double Down is only shown on the first turn. Split is only shown on the first turn when the user has two cards of the same face.
\item If the user chooses the Hit option, the user will be dealt another card.
\item If the user chooses the Stand option, the dealer will begin their turn.
\item If the user chooses the Double Down option, the user will place a bet with the same value as the ante bet and be dealt another card. After this, the dealer's turn begins.
\item If the user chooses the Split option, the user's two cards will be split into separate hands. Each hand will be dealt another card, giving the user two hands with two cards each. The user can play each hand separately.
\item After the user's turn is over, the dealer's turn begins. The dealer uses the same options the user has.
\item After the dealer's turn is over the user's hand and the dealer's hand are compared. The hand with the closest point value to 21 is the winner.
\item After the game is over, the user may enter another bet or exit to the main menu.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Use Case 4: Navigate the Main Menu}
See Figure \ref{fig:main}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user can click the ``Blackjack" button to go to the blackjack game screen.
\item The user can click the ``Log Out" button to log out of their account and go back to the log in/sign up screen.
\item The user can click the ``X" button at the top right corner of the screen to exit the program.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Use Case 5: Exit the Program}
See Figure \ref{fig:main}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user can click the ``X" button at the top right corner of the main menu screen to exit the program.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Structure}
\noindent
This section covers the general structure of our app. We designed our project's structure to be flexible and expandable. We made our project modular by using pages, which can be swapped in and out as needed. This means new pages can be added and removed very easily, and one page does not necessarily depend on another. Another way we made our project modular is that some of the classes we used in the Blackjack\_Page can be used in another card game. These classes are the CardFactory class, the card struct, and the CardType enum. All of these classes can be applied to a different card game.

\subsection{UML Outline}
\noindent
This section provides a UML outline of the project (see Figure \ref{fig:outline1} and Figure \ref{fig:outline2}). The outline was too big for one picture, so we had to separate it into two parts.\\
\newline
The project's structure hinges on a MainWindow object. The window has an object called a Frame that holds the page the user is currently on. At launch, the frame contains the log in/sign up page. To navigate between pages, we simply set the frame's content to a new instance of the page we want to navigate to. For each of the following pages, a reference to this frame is passed.\\
\newline
The log in/sign up page connects to the MS Access database through OleDb to log a user in or create an account for them. This page has two main methods: LoginSubmit\_Click and SignUpSubmit\_Click. As their names imply, these methods handle log ins and sign ups respectively.  LoginSubmit\_Click hashes whatever the user entered into the username and password fields on the page and compares them to every account in the database. If a match is found, then the user is logged in with that account. If not, the user is prompted to try again. SignUpSubmit\_Click
checks the validity of the username and password the user submitted and creates a new account in the database for the user if they are valid.\\
\newline
The main menu page serves as a hub for navigation to other pages. Currently you can only navigate to the blackjack page and log out, but there is room for expansion when we get to that point. The two methods of this class, Black\_Jack\_Button\_Click and log\_out\_btn\_Click serve this purpose. They siimply navigate the user to the appropriate page.\\
\newline
The bet page does exactly what it implies: it allows the user to place a bet before they get into the game. Whenever the user enters a bet, the an event is raised that calls bet\_input\_TextChanged. This method validates the bet the user typed into the textbox. If the bet is valid, the user may click the submit button and navigate to their chosen game. The functionality for this is handled by submit\_btn\_Click.\\
\newline
The blackjack page is where the blackjack game is played. This class has several methods.There are four methods that represent actions the user can take in the game. These actions are hit, stand, double down, and split. There are four buttons that handle the logic behind these actions. Double down and split are only available on the player's first turn after they are dealt their starting hand. There are five methods in this class that deal with the functionality of the game. The first is checkHand, which checks the state of the given hand and returns that state as a string. So if the user has a blackjack, it will return ``blackjack." It will return the point value of the hand if the hand has no special state. A similar type of method is the insertCard method. This method simply adds a card to the given hand. The next method is Deal. This method initializes the game by dealing two random cards to the player and dealer. This method also handles blackjacks when needed. When the player clicks the stand button, dealerPlay is called. This method handles the logic behind the dealer's turn. This is made easy by the fact that the dealer must follow certain rules. The final functionality method is the play\_btn\_Click method. This method reveals the page content and calls Deal, which initializes the game. The last method in this class is the exit\_btn\_Click method, which simply closes the application.\\
\newline
Inside of the blackjack page class are three other classes: CardFactory, a card struct, and the CardType enum. The card struct defines what a card is. It contains three primitive values: ``value", ``suit", and ``face." ``value" is the amount of points a card is worth. ``suit" is the suit of the card (e.g. hearts). ``face" is what is displayed on the card (e.g. `K' for a King). CardType defines every card in a standard deck of cards (52 cards in total). CardFactory is an implementation of the Factory Method design pattern. Its role is to create a card object given a CardType.

\subsection{Design Patterns Used}
We used the Factory creational pattern and the Façade structural pattern for this project. We used the Factory Method to create objects that represent cards in our game. We chose to use this pattern because we needed a method of generating many different variations of the same object, and the Factory Method does that well. We used Façade to make playing the game much easier for the user. All the user needs to do  to control the game's subsystems is click some buttons.

\section{Results}
Looking back on the project, we managed to create a functional app with the limited time we had. We were forced to completely abandon most of our original plans for the structure of the project. As we developed the app, we discovered that our structure would definitely not work, so we had to quickly adapt to the changes in the structure. There is definitely room for improvement and expansion in the app, which is described in the Future Work section. As for our accomplishments, firstly we created a functional, albeit simple, user authentitication system using a Microsoft Access database. Second, we implemented user balances in the database. Finally, we created a functional blackjack game. Given more time, we could make many more accomplishments.


\section{Future Work}
In the future, we would like to expand the scope of our app to include the other games we originally planned to include: three-card poker and roulette. Another game we could potentially implement is  Texas Hold'em style poker game that can be played over the internet. Unfortunatley, due to time constraints we were only able to implement blackjack into the app. Finally, we would like to implement a tutorial page that contains tutorials for each game.
